Meaning of delivery/drainage fields and projection (seems to just mean overlap -> blood delivered by one vessel is same blood that arrives in another)

- Steps for skeletonisation


Bit about functional apex in episcleral arterial circle arcade - stationary point?



Necessary to save as bitmap to avoid compression with opencv. Saving as .tif compresses behind the scenes.
